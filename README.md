# **Project 3 Battleships**

## **Milestone Project 3 for Code Institute Full Stack Software Development.**
### Author - Daniel Cave

Battleships is a fully designed back-end Python based terminal game which has been created and running on a terminal hosted on Heroku.

The Battleship game follows the standard practice of the user guessing a location of the opponents battleships to sink and win the game. The Python based game is design and used in a terminal location using the rows and colums to guess the oppents battleship locations to then sink and win.

Live version of the game avalible on Heroku - <a href="https://p3-battleship-dc-6afed2473960.herokuapp.com/">Click Here!</a>

## **User Experience**
### **Target Audience**
The target audience of the game are fans of the classic game Battleships. The deployed program will allow the user to play the game against a randomised computor output that they are able to play against multiple times.

### **Website Goals**
The primary goal of the website is to operate a functional game of battleships created with python and deployed to a working instance of the game. It is designed to allow the user to play a complete game of battle ships against the computor and feel like a classic game of battleship that the user would play in a physical enviroment or on a game provided server or mobile.

## **User Stories**
- ## New User Visitor Goals
1. The game is designed to allow new users to complete a game of battleship on the deployed Heroku App.
2. Give the user clear instructions on how to play the game of battleships and score to know who has won.
3. Have a fair and complete game where does not feel that the computer will always win.

- ### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. To complete a game of battleship that they either won or lost to enjoy.
    2. Test there skills in the game of battleship to better understand the game.
    3. Have a enjoyable time against the computer to feel challenge but able to beat the computer.

## Design
- How to play:

The design of the game is based of the classic game of battleships. The main aim is to guess a location on the oppenents board to try and sink all of there battle ships. The game allows the user to guess and use strategic guessing to locate and destroy all of the oppents ships.

The rules of the game are a simplistic concept. The user has a 6x6 board to guess the location of all of the ships. The user is prompted to pick a row between the values of 1-6. Once the user has inputted their choice, they are then asked to input a colum, ranges from A through to F. That is then entered into the game to determine if the players misses the battleship or hits the battle ship. If the player misses a Circle or O i posted on the players chosen spot and a turn is deducted from there turns. If the player guesses correctly, then the program displays an X on the spot and notifies the player of a hit and no turn is removed.
